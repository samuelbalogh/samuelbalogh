# Hi there! 👋 I'm Sam

I'm a software engineer who loves building things that make a difference. Currently based in Budapest, Hungary, I spend my days crafting elegant solutions to complex problems and my nights exploring new technologies that catch my eye.

## What I'm Up To 🚀

Right now, I'm pouring my creative energy into [cards.samu.space](http://cards.samu.space), a flashcard application that's redefining how we learn and retain information. It's not just another flashcard app – it's a sophisticated learning platform that leverages the power of AI to generate intelligent content. The system uses advanced techniques like TLSH (Tuned Locality Sensitive Hashing) for duplicate detection and implements a two-tier keyword system for precise content categorization. Built with React, FastAPI, and MongoDB, it's a testament to my passion for creating robust, user-friendly applications that solve real-world problems.

## Professional Journey 🛠️

My path in tech has been an exciting journey of continuous learning and growth. I've had the privilege of working with anazing ad inspirig people, using various technologies and frameworks, and what drives me is the opportunity to build systems that make a meaningful impact.

### Technical Expertise

- **Languages & Frameworks**: Python (Django, FastAPI), JavaScript/TypeScript (React, Node.js)
- **Cloud & Infrastructure**: AWS, Docker, Kubernetes
- **Databases**: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis
- **AI & Machine Learning**: OpenAI API integration, RAG systems, LLM applications

## Writing & Sharing Knowledge 📝

I maintain a technical blog at [samu.space](https://samu.space) where I share insights about software engineering, cloud technologies, and my experiences in the tech world. My writing style aims to break down complex concepts into digestible pieces, making technology more accessible to everyone.

## Philosophy & Approach 💭

I believe in:
- Writing clean, maintainable code that tells a story
- Building systems that scale not just technically, but also in terms of user value
- Continuous learning and sharing knowledge with the community
- Making technology more accessible and user-friendly

## Let's Connect! 🤝

I'm always excited to collaborate on interesting projects or just have a good technical discussion. Whether you're interested in my work, have questions about my projects, or want to discuss potential collaborations, feel free to reach out!
